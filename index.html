            <h2>About Kedarnath</h2>
            <article>
                One of the most revered temple destinations of India, Kedarnath town is nestled in the mighty Garhwal Himalayas. The town, built around the revered Kedarnath temple, is located at an altitude of 3,580 m, near Chorabari glacier, which is the source of the Mandakini river. </article> <br><article>Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the ancient temple has exquisite architecture and is built of extremely large but evenly shaped grey stone slabs. A conical rock formation inside the temple is worshipped as Lord Shiva in his “Sadashiva” form. The Kedarnath temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a part of Char Dham pilgrimage circuit, and is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva in India. <br> <br>Behind the Kedarnath temple, stand the Kedarnath peak, Kedar Dome and other Himalayan peaks.The historical name of this region is "Kedar Khand" and legend says, the Pandavas from the epic Mahabharata, after having defeated the Kauravas, felt guilty of having killed so many people and sought the blessings of Lord Shiva for redemption. The Lord eluded them repeatedly and took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull. The Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the surface at Kedarnath. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations.

            <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
            <article>
                In Hindu tradition, it is believed that Lord Shiva manifested in form of Jyotirlingam or the cosmic light. There are 12 such Jyotirlingas and Kedarnath is highest among them. This magnificent temple is ancient and constructed over a thousand years ago by Jagad Guru Adi Shankaracharya. It is located in the Rudra Himalaya range of Uttarakhand State. It is situated at an altitude of 3,581 mt & it is a 16 km trek from the nearest place of Gaurikund.
            </article><br>
            <article>The Kedarnath temple is built of massive stone slabs over a large rectangular platform. The temple is ascended through large grey Steps which leads to the Holy Sanctums. We can find inscriptions in Pali language on the steps. The inner walls of the temple sanctum are adorned with figures of various deities and scenes from mythology.</article><br>
            <article>The origin of Kedarnath temple can be traced to the great epic - Mahabharata. According to legends, after winning the battle of Mahabharata against the Gauravas, the Pandavas sought blessings of Lord Shiva to atone their sins of Killing men during the war. Lord Shiva eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing from them took refuge at Kedarnath in form of a bafellow. On being followed by the Pandavas, he dived into ground at the exact place where the Holy Sanctum is now present, leaving behind his hump on the floor surface, which is now visible. This Hump inside the temple is in the form of a conical rock formation and is worshipped as Lord Shiva manifested in his Sadashiva form. The Pujas and Archanas are performed on this manifestation by priests and piligrims. There is also a Holy Statue of Lod Shiva inside the temple, which is the portable manifestation (Utsavar) of the Lord.Outside the temple door, a large statue of Nandi bafellow stands as guard. The temple, has been continually renovated over the centuries.</article><br>
            <article>Kedarnath experiences very heavy Snowfall in Winter (upto several metres) and the temple itself is blanketed with snow from Novemner to April. So, at the onset of Winter every year, which is normally in the First week of November and on an auspicious date which is announced in advance by the holy symbolic statue of Lord Shiva is carried down from Kedarnath temple to a place called Ukhimath, where it is worshipped as Lord Shiva. The pujas and archanas are done at Ukhimath from November till May of next year. In the first week of May and on an auspicious date which is announced in advance by BKTC the symbolic statue of Lord Shiva is carried back from Ukhimath to Kedarnath and reinstated in the original place. It is at this time, that the doors of the temple are thrown open to pilgrims, who flock from all parts of India, for a holy pilgrimage. The shrine generally closes on the first day of Kartik (Oct-Nov) and reopens in Vaishakh (Apr-May) every year.</article>

            <h2><strong>Places To Visit</strong></h2>
            <article>The Kedarnath trek located within the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, a 16-km route from Gaurikund to Kedarnath temple, is the most popular here. The trail meanders through forest-covered mountains, glaciers and is criss-crossed by numerous waterfalls. It is a medium to steep trek. There are fixed timings for the trek; 4 am to 1.30 pm, to coincide with the time slots of the sanctuary. The 800-m uphill trek from Kedarnath to Bhairavnath Temple or Bhairon Baba Mandir also falls on this route and offers magnificent views of the Kedarnath Temple and the verdant Kedarnath Valley. From Kedarnath, one can also trek to Chandrashila, a summit located 32 km away.</article><br>
            <article>One can also enjoy the natural beauty of the region by setting up tents near Kedarnath town. Experience the divine surroundings with the towering Kedarnath peak looming large and star-filled sky during night.</article><br>
            <article>The Kedarnath peak and Kedarnath Dome both offer great rock climbing opportunities with rocks, ice walls, crevasses, etc, attracting professional climbers. Both peaks have relatively easy routes on their northwest sides. The east face of Kedar Dome is more challenging to climb</article>
